  git subrepo status [<subdir>]
  git subrepo clean <subdir>

  git subrepo help [<command>]
  git subrepo version

= Description

This git command "clones" an external git repo into a subdirectory of your
repo. Later on, upstream changes can be pulled in, and local changes can be
pushed back. Simple.

= Benefits

This command is an improvement from `git-submodule` and `git-subtree`; two
other git commands with similar goals, but various problems.

It assumes there are 3 main roles of people interacting with a repo, and
attempts to serve them all well:

* *owner* - The person who authors\/owns\/maintains a repo.
* *users* - People who are just using/installing the repo.
* *collaborators* - People who commit code to the repo and subrepos.

The `git-subrepo` command benefits these roles in the following ways:

* Simple and intuitive commandline usage.
* Users get your repo and all your subrepos just by cloning your repo.
* Users do not need to install `git-subrepo`, ever.
* Collaborators do not need to install unless they want to push/pull.
* Collaborators know when a subdir is a subrepo (it has a `.gitrepo` file).
* Well named branches and remotes are generated for manual operations.
* Owners do not deal with the complications of keeping submodules in sync.
* Subrepo repositories can contain subrepos themselves.
* Branching with subrepos JustWorks™.
* Different branches can have different subrepos in different states, etc.
* Moving\/renaming\/deleting a subrepo subdir JustWorks™.
* You can `init` an existing subdirectory into a subrepo.
* Your git history is kept squeaky clean.
* Upstream history (clone/pull) is condensed into a single commit.
* You can see the subrepo history with `git log subrepo/<subdir>/upstream`.
* Commits pushed back upstream are *not* condensed.
* Trivial to try any subrepo operations and then reset back.
* No configuration required.
* Does not introduce history that messes up other git commands.
* Fixes known rebase failures with `git-subtree`.

= Installation

The best short answer is:

  git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo /path/to/git-subrepo
  echo 'source /path/to/git-subrepo/init' >> ~/.bashrc

The complete "Installation Instructions" can be found below.

= Commands

All the *subrepo* commands use names of actual Git commands and try to do
operations that are similar to their Git counterparts. They also attempt to
give similar output in an attempt to make the subrepo usage intuitive to
experienced Git users.

Please note that the commands are /not/ exact equivalents, and do not take all
the same arguments. Keep reading…

- `git subrepo clone <repository> [<subdir>] [-b <upstream-branch>] [-f]`

  Add a repository as a subrepo in a subdir of your repository.

  This is similar in feel to `git clone`. You just specify the remote repo
  url, and optionally a sub-directory and/or branch name. The repo will be
  fetched and merged into the subdir.

  The subrepo history is /squashed/ into a single commit that contains the
  reference information. This information is also stored in a special file
  called `<subdir>/.gitrepo`. The presence of this file indicates that the
  directory is a subrepo.

  All subsequent commands refer to the subrepo by the name of the /subdir/.
  From the subdir, all the current information about the subrepo can be
  obtained.

  The `--force` option will "reclone" (completely replace) an existing subdir.

  The `clone` command accepts the `--branch=` and `--force` options.

- `git subrepo init <subdir> [-r <remote>] [-b <branch>]`

  Turn an existing subdirectory into a subrepo.

  If you want to expose a subdirectory of your project as a published subrepo,
  this command will do that. It will split out the content of a normal
  subdirectory into a branch and start tracking it as a subrepo. Afterwards
  your original repo will look exactly the same except that there will be a
  `<subdir>/.gitrepo` file.

  If you specify the `--remote` (and optionally the `--branch`) option, the
  values will be added to the `<subdir>/.gitrepo` file. The `--remote` option
  is the upstream URL, and the `--branch` option is the upstream branch to
  push to. These values will be needed to do a `git subrepo push` command, but
  they can be provided later on the `push` command (and saved to
  `<subdir>/.gitrepo` if you also specify the `--update` option).

  Note: You will need to create the empty upstream repo and push to it on your
  own, using `git subrepo push <subdir>`.

  The `init` command accepts the `--branch=` and `--remote=` options.

- `git subrepo pull <subdir>|--all [-b <branch>] [-r <remote>] [-u]`

  Update the subrepo subdir with the latest upstream changes.

  The `pull` command will attempt to do the following commands in one go:

    git subrepo fetch <subdir>
    git subrepo branch <subdir>
    git subrepo merge-base subrepo/<subdir>/upstream subrepo/<subdir>
    git rebase --onto <new_parent> <old_parent> subrepo/<subdir>
    git rebase subrepo/<subdir>/upstream subrepo/<subdir>
    git checkout ORIG_HEAD
    git subrepo commit <subdir>

  In other words, you could do all the above commands yourself, for the same
  effect. If any of the commands fail, subrepo will stop and tell you to
  finish this by hand. Generally a failure would be in the rebase, where
  conflicts can happen. Since Git has lots of ways to resolve conflicts to
  your personal tastes, the subrepo command defers to letting you do this by
  hand.

  Like the `clone` command, `pull` will squash all the changes (since the last
  pull or clone) into one commit. This keeps your mainline history nice and
  clean. You can easily see the subrepo's history with the `git log` command:

    git log refs/subrepo/<subdir>/upstream

  The set of commands used above are described in detail below.

  The `pull` command accepts the `--all`, `--branch=`, `--remote=` and
  `--update` options.

- `git subrepo push <subdir>|--all [<branch>] [-r <remote>] [-b <branch>] [-u]`

  Push a properly merged subrepo branch back upstream.

  The `push` command requires a branch that has been properly merged/rebased
  with the upstream HEAD (unless the upstream HEAD is empty, which is common
  when doing a first `push` after an `init`). That means the upstream HEAD is
  one of the commits in the branch. If you don't specify a branch to push, one
  will be created for you using the same techniques as a pull (except it won't
  be committed locally). Otherwise you can name a properly merged branch to
  push. Often times you can use the branch commit from the last pull, which is
  saved as `refs/subrepo/<subdir>/pull`.

  After that, the `push` command just checks that the branch contains the
  upstream HEAD and then pushes it upstream.

  The `--force` option will do a force push. Force pushes are typically
  discouraged. Only use this option if you fully understand it. (The `--force`
  option will NOT check for a proper merge. ANY branch will be force pushed!)

  The `push` command accepts the `--all`, `--branch=`, `--force`, `--remote=`
  and `--update` options.

- `git subrepo fetch <subdir>|--all`

  Fetch the remote/upstream content for a subrepo.

  It will create a Git reference called `subrepo/<subdir>/upstream` that
  points at the same commit as `FETCH_HEAD`. It will also create a remote
  called `subrepo/<subdir>`. These are temporary and you can remove them
  easily with the subrepo `clean` command.

  The `fetch` command accepts the `--all`, `--branch=` and `--remote=`
  options.

- `git subrepo branch <subdir>|--all`

  Create a branch with local subrepo commits.

  Scan the history of the mainline for all the commits that affect the
  `subdir` and create a new branch from them called `subrepo/<subdir>`.

  This is useful for doing `pull` and `push` commands by hand.

  Use the `--force` option to write over an existing `subrepo/<subdir>`
  branch.

  The `branch` command accepts the `--all` and `--force` options.

- `git subrepo commit <subdir> [<subrepo-ref>]`

  Add subrepo branch to current history as a single commit.

  This command is generally used after a hand-merge. You have done a `subrepo
  branch` and merged (rebased) it with the upstream. This command takes the
  HEAD of that branch, puts its content into the subrepo subdir and adds a new
  commit for it to the top of your mainline history.

  This command requires that the upstream HEAD be in the `subrepo/<subdir>`
  branch history. That way the same branch can push upstream. Use the
  `--force` option to commit anyway.

  The `commit` command accepts the `--force` option.

- `git subrepo merge-base <branch1> <branch2>`

  Find a common ancestor between two branches. This command will look at the 
  referenced tree hash in the commits to see if it can locate a common one.

  This is used for pull and push before the rebase step. In this case we look
  at all the local commits and then try to find a tree hash that is available
  in the subrepo.

  Note: This is different from the regular merge-base that looks at the object
  structure. 

- `git subrepo status [<subdir>]`

  Get the status of a subrepo. Show the status of all subrepos by default. If
  the `--quiet` flag is used, just print the subrepo names, one per line.

  The `--verbose` option will show all the recent local and upstream commits.

  The `status` command accepts the `--fetch` option.

- `git subrepo clean <subdir>|--all`

  Remove artifacts created by `fetch` and `branch` commands.

  The `fetch` and `branch` operations (and other commands that call them)
  create temporary things like refs, branches and remotes. This command
  removes all those things.

  Use `--force` to remove refs. Refs are not removed by default because they
  are sometimes needed between commands. To remove all subrepo artifacts:

    git subrepo clean --all --force

  The `clean` command takes the `--all` and `--force` options.

- `git subrepo help`

  Same as `git help subrepo`. Will launch the manpage. For the shorter usage,
  use `git subrepo -h`.

- `git subrepo version [--verbose] [--quiet]`

  This command will display version information about git-subrepo and its
  environment. For just the version number, use `git subrepo --version`. Use
  `--verbose` for more version info, and `--quiet` for less.

= Command Options

- `-h`

  Show a brief view of the commands and options.

- `--help`

  Gives an overview of the help options available for the subrepo command.

- `--version`

  Print the git-subrepo version. Just the version number. Try the `version`
  command for more version info.

- `--all` (`-a`)

  If you have multiple subrepos, issue the command to all of them (if
  applicable).

- `--branch=<branch-name>` (`-b <branch-name>`)

  Use a different branch-name than the remote HEAD or the one saved in
  `.gitrepo` locally.

- `--force` (`-f`)

  Use this option to force certain commands that fail in the general case.

- `--fetch` (`-F`)

  Use this option to fetch the upstream commits, before running the command.

- `--remote=<remote-url>` (`-r <remote-url>`)

  Use a different remote-url than the one saved in `.gitrepo` locally.

- `--update` (`-u`)

  If `-b` or `-r` are used, and the command updates the `.gitrepo` file,
  include these values to the update.

= Output Options

- `--quiet` (`-q`)

  Print as little info as possible. Applicable to most commands.

- `--verbose` (`-v`)

  Print more information about the command execution and results. Applicable
  to most commands.

- `--debug` (`-d`)

  Show the actual git (and other) commands being executed under the hood.
  Applicable to most commands.

- `--DEBUG` (`-x`)

  Use the Bash `set -x` option which prints every command before it is run.
  VERY noisy, but extremely useful in deep debugging. Applicable to all
  commands.

= Installation Instructions

There are currently 3 ways to install `git-subrepo`. For all of them you need
to get the source code from GitHub:

  git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo /path/to/git-subrepo

The first installation method is preferred: `source` the `init` file. Just add
a line like this one to your shell startup script:

  source /path/to/git-subrepo/init

That will modify your `PATH` and `MANPATH`, and also enable command
completion.

The second method is to do these things by hand. This might afford you more
control of your shell environment. Simply add the `lib` and `man` directories
to your `PATH` and `MANPATH`:

  export PATH="/path/to/git-subrepo/lib:$PATH"
  export MANPATH="/path/to/git-subrepo/man:$MANPATH"

See below for info on how to turn on Command Completion.

The third method is a standard system install, which puts `git-subrepo` next
to your other git commands:

  make install        # Possibly with 'sudo'

This method does not account for upgrading and command completion yet.

= Upgrading

If you used the `PATH` method of installation, just run this to upgrade
`git-subrepo`:

  git subrepo upgrade

Or (same thing):

  cd /path/to/git-subrepo
  git pull

If you used `make install` method, then run this again (after `git pull`):

  make install        # Possibly with 'sudo'

= Command Completion

The `git subrepo` command supports `<TAB>`-based command completion. If you
don't use the `init` script (see Installation, above), you'll need to enable
this manually to use it.

== In Bash

If your Bash setup does not already provide command completion for Git, you'll
need to enable that first:

  source <Git completion script>

On your system, the Git completion script might be found at any of the
following locations (or somewhere else that we don't know about):

* `/etc/bash_completion.d/git`
* `/usr/share/bash-completion/git`
* `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git`
* `/opt/local/share/bash-completion/completions/git`
* `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git`
* `~/.homebrew/etc/bash_completion.d/git`

In case you can't find any of these, this repository contains a copy of the
Git completion script:

  source /path/to/git-subrepo/share/git-completion.bash

Once Git completion is enabled (whether you needed to do that manually or
not), you can turn on `git-subrepo` completion with a command like this:

  source /path/to/git-subrepo/share/completion.bash

== In zsh

In the Z shell (zsh), you can manually enable `git-subrepo` completion by
adding the following line to your `~/.zshrc`, *before* the `compinit` function
is called:

  fpath=('/path/to/git-subrepo/share/zsh-completion' $fpath)

= Status

The git-subrepo command has been in use for well over a year and seems to get
the job done. Development is still ongoing but mostly just for fixing bugs.

Trying subrepo out is simple and painless (this is not `git submodule`).
Nothing is permanent (if you do not push to shared remotes). ie You can always
play around and reset back to the beginning without pain.

This command has a test suite (run `make test`), but surely has many bugs. If
you have expertise with Git and subcommands, please review the code, and file
issues on anything that seems wrong.

If you want to chat about the `git-subrepo` command, join `#git-commands` on
`irc.freenode.net`.

= Notes

* This command currently only works on POSIX systems.
  * Windows support via msysgit is being looked into (works on cygwin).
* The `git-subrepo` repo itself has 2 subrepos under the `ext/` subdirectory.
* Written in (very modern) Bash, with full test suite. Take a look.
* A `.gitrepo` file never is in the top level dir (next to a `.git/` dir).
